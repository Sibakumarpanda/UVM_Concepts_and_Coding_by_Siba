UVM Barrier Concept Understanding:

-Similar to the UVM event, UVM provides another way to achieve synchronization with the UVM Barrier.
-The UVM barrier provides multi-process synchronization that blocks a set of processes until the desired number of processes reaches a particular synchronizing point at which all the processes are released.
-UVM Barrier Class Declaration:  class uvm_barrier extends uvm_object

UVM Barrier Usage:
-UVM Barrier is used to synchronize the number of processes based on the threshold value set by the set_threshold method. 
-Once the threshold is reached, the processes are unblocked by the wait_for method.
